// The Dashboard's charts (phase 4, module 3). Pure functions over the same
// rows the reports use, so a chart and its report agree:
//
//   - A training belongs to the month it starts in (as in the reports).
//   - Hours are those that count toward a person's record (completed, training
//     not cancelled); a chart only adds them up differently.
//   - "Average per person" divides by the manpower headcount, as the
//     department report does.
//   - A period of up to two years is drawn month by month; a longer one, year
//     by year, so the columns stay readable.
