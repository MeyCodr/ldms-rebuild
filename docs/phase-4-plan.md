# Phase 4: Reminders, notifications, the daily job and dashboards

Build plan for LDMS v2 phase 4. **Approved 8 Oct 2026; the answers are in §3.** Question 4 (a closing date for TNA and TNI) is to be confirmed at module 2. Written
after reading the old system's reminder scripts and dashboards (`C:\Apache24\htdocs\ldms`) and counting, without
reading any personal data, what is in its database (`phnportalenterto_trms`, read-only). Read with `README.md`,
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/phase-3-plan.md`.

**How to work:** as in phases 2 and 3. One module at a time, in the order in §7; after each: typecheck, lint, unit
tests, e2e tests, screenshots at desktop and phone width, then stop for review.

---

## 1. Where things stand

- Phases 1 to 3 are on master: org chart, staff, sign-in, permissions, audit log, trainings, attendance, My
  training, OJT, certificates, reports, PME, skill matrix, TNA and TNI.
- **Already in place for phase 4**
  - What is waiting on each person is worked out today, on screen only: `feedbackWaiting`, `pmeWaiting`,
    `skillWaiting` and `tnaWaiting` feed the sidebar counts, the Approvals page and the overview's *Waiting on you*.
  - A `mail.testMode` setting (on, with a test address) has been in the seed since phase 1. Nothing reads it yet.
  - The org and staff data checks already flag *Managers and executives without email*.
  - The overview has L&D's figures for the year (learning hours by month, attendance to record, spend, headcount by
    division), and Reports has staff hours, department hours, attendance and the audit log, each with an Excel export.
  - `ColumnChart` draws one series of columns. There is no chart with two series or stacked parts yet.
- **Missing**: anything that sends an email, anything that runs by itself, a record of what was sent, a notification
  list, and any chart about PME, skill matrix, TNA or TNI across departments.

## 2. What the old system does

### 2.1 Reminders

One runner, `scripts/run_reminders.sh`, started once a day by the server's scheduler (8am Malaysia time), runs three
scripts one after another and writes what each printed to a log file.

| Script | To whom | What | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notify_pme_incomplete.php` | Each HOD | One email listing every PME of theirs whose 3-month period has ended and is still not evaluated | Every day until none are left |
| `notify_attendance_incomplete.php` | Each participant | One email listing every training that has ended whose attendance form they haven't filled in | Every day until none are left |
| `reminder.php` | Three L&D addresses, typed into the code | Trainings that started exactly 3 months ago | On that day |

Also in the PME script: PMEs for trainings of 4 hours or less are closed before anyone is reminded (v2 needs no job for
this; they are *Not required* from the start). Three older scripts (`notify_hod`, `notify_admin`,
`notify_participation`) are no longer run.

What the code and the database show:

- Both daily scripts **are in test mode in this copy of the code**: every email goes to one test address, with the
  real recipient named in the subject. They have run every day since 7 and 8 September 2026 (27 and 26 runs). Whether
  the live server has been switched to real recipients is a question for whoever deployed it.
- The backlog today: **82 PMEs** past their period across **17 HODs**, and **144 attendance forms** not filled in by
  **126 staff**.
- **Only 447 of about 3,100 active staff have an email address on record.** All 39 HODs do; so do 137 of 140
  managers and 136 of 155 executives. Among non-executive staff it is 172 of 1,356, and among contract staff 2 of
  1,465. Email reaches the office; it does not reach the shop floor.
- Each script marks the day as sent **before** sending, so a failure halfway means the rest wait until tomorrow. There
  is no record of who was sent what, only the printed log.
- Email goes through Office 365 with a mailbox sign-in. **The mailbox password is written into five source files**,
  and each script's web address is protected only by a token that is also in the code. See §9.
- No reminders exist for skill matrix, TNA or TNI, and none for the staff member's or L&D's PME step.

### 2.2 Dashboards

Every role has a dashboard page, all about **training hours**; none shows PME, skill matrix, TNA or TNI. L&D's has:

- Seven figures: trainings, staff trained, headcount, days, total hours, public hours, OJT hours.
- **Public and OJT** hours side by side, **cost by month**, the **top 10 staff by hours**, and **average training
  hours per person by month**.
- **One chart per division** (nine of them), each with its departments.
- A switch on most charts between **total man-hours** and **average hours per person**, a date range and a year picker.
- A table of staff with their total hours.

The HOD's, the clerks' and ordinary staff's pages are cut-down copies of the same page, 1,200 to 1,500 lines each.
Ordinary staff see the company-wide division charts too. The skill matrix has its own chart page, which v2 already has.

About half of trainings have a cost entered (81 of 152 in 2026), so a cost chart undercounts.

---

## 3. Decisions (8 Oct 2026)

Each has what the old system does, what was recommended and its downside. **The answers:**

- **1**: one combined email per person, **every day until resolved**, as the old system does. No weekly option, so
  there is no `reminders.cadence` setting.
- **4**: open. There is no closing-date field today; the proposal is an optional one in the *Open year* dialog.
  Decide at module 2.
- **8**: SMTP, with the settings in `.env`.
- **9**: a **Linux** server; the daily job is a `cron` line.
- **12**: **yes**, the old PDF reports are needed. Added as module 5: the PME report, the training audit report and
  the OJT audit report, unless fewer are named.
- **2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11**: as recommended.

### Reminders

| # | Question | Old system | Recommended for v2 | Downside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **How often?** | Every day until done. | **One email per person**, listing everything waiting on them. Sent the day something new is waiting, then **every Monday** while anything remains. L&D can switch it to every working day. | Slower chasing than daily. L&D chose daily only a month ago, so they may want daily kept; that is why it is a switch and not fixed. A HOD with 30 overdue PMEs learns to delete a daily email. |
| 2 | **Which things are chased?** | PME for the HOD; attendance form for the participant. | Everything that already appears under *Waiting on you*, listed in §4: twelve kinds, each one L&D can switch off. | More email than today. The single combined email keeps it to one per person. |
| 3 | **Skill matrices not yet filled in** | No reminder. | Remind the department's evaluators **only in the last month** before the quarter closes, with the number of staff still without one. | Several people can fill them in, so each may assume another will. The HOD's dashboard (question 10) shows the same number, which is the real pressure. |
| 4 | **TNAs and TNIs not yet started** | No reminder, and no deadline. | **No reminder unless L&D set a closing date** when they open the year. With a date: remind from 14 days before. | Needs a small addition to the *Open year* dialog. Without a date nobody is chased to start, as today. A reminder with no deadline behind it is noise. |
| 5 | **Staff with no email** (about 2,650) | Skipped; counted in the log. | They get the **in-LDMS notification** only. L&D's run summary lists how many were skipped, by department, with a link to the staff list. | They only see it if they sign in. Nothing in phase 4 fixes that; a kiosk or a printed list from the clerk would. |
| 6 | **The first live run** | A cut-off date in the code, so the first run didn't send the whole backlog. | A **Chase from** date L&D set when they switch test mode off. Older items still show on screen but aren't emailed. | Older backlog isn't chased by email unless L&D move the date back. |
| 7 | **Can a person turn their reminders off?** | No. | **No.** L&D switch a kind on or off for everyone. | Someone on long leave still gets them. |

### Sending and running

| # | Question | Old system | Recommended for v2 | Downside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | **How is email sent?** | Office 365, signing in as a mailbox with a password. | The same mailbox through SMTP, with the address and password in the server's `.env` file and **a new password**. Built behind one small piece of code so it can be swapped. **I need IT to confirm** the mailbox can still sign in this way: Microsoft has been retiring password sign-in for sending mail, and I can't see from here whether the old emails are actually being delivered. | If IT say no, the alternative is sending through Microsoft Graph with an app registration, which IT must set up. About a day more work. |
| 9 | **Where does the daily job run?** | The server's scheduler runs a script; a web address with a token as a fallback. | A command, `npm run job:daily`, run by the server's scheduler (Task Scheduler on Windows, cron on Linux) at 8am. **No web address.** L&D also get a **Run now** button. | Someone must set the schedule up once on the server. I need to know which system v2 will be hosted on. |

### Dashboards and exports

| # | Question | Old system | Recommended for v2 | Downside |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **What is charted?** | Training hours only. | A **Dashboard** screen with two parts. *Training*: the old charts worth keeping (§6). *Workflows*: how far each department has got with PME, skill matrix, TNA and TNI. | The nine per-division charts become one chart with a division picker; anyone used to seeing all nine at once has to click. |
| 11 | **Who sees it?** | Everyone, company-wide. | **L&D** see everything. A **HOD** sees their department, a **division head** their division. Other staff keep their own figures on the overview. | Ordinary staff lose the company-wide charts and the top 10 list. Showing a ranked list of named colleagues to 3,000 people is the part I'd question. |
| 12 | **PDF reports in the old layouts** (PME report, audit reports) | Three PDF pages. | **Not in phase 4** unless L&D name one an auditor asks for. Excel exports exist for all of them. | If an auditor does want the exact old layout, it is added later, one report at a time. |

**Before module 0, I also recommend** spending a short session on the end-to-end tests. A few fail on a full run and
pass when run alone, and the cause isn't known. A daily job and emails add more things that depend on time, so the
checks need to be dependable first.

---

## 4. The reminders

One list per person, built from the same rules that fill *Waiting on you*, so the email and the screen never disagree.

| # | What is waiting | Who is told | Becomes due |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Feedback form for a training that has ended | The participant | The day after the training ends |
| 2 | PME to evaluate | The HOD | When the 3-month period ends |
| 3 | PME to acknowledge | The staff member | When the HOD evaluates |
| 4 | PME sent back by L&D | The HOD | When sent back |
| 5 | PME to verify | L&D | When acknowledged |
| 6 | Attendance to record for a training that has ended | L&D | The day after it ends |
| 7 | Skill matrices not filled in | The department's evaluators | The last month before the quarter closes (question 3) |
| 8 | Skill matrix to approve | The HOD | When submitted |
| 9 | Skill matrix sent back | The evaluator who filled it in | When sent back |
| 10 | TNA to approve | The HOD | When submitted |
| 11 | TNA sent back | The staff member, or the main clerk for a job grade | When sent back |
| 12 | TNA or TNI not started | The staff member; the HOD for a TNI | 14 days before the closing date, if L&D set one (question 4) |

- **The email**: plain and short. Who it is for, each kind as a heading with a count and up to ten lines (name,
  training or quarter, how many days it has waited), and one link into LDMS for each kind. The old L&D greeting and
  sign-off lines are kept.
- **Never sent twice**: each email is recorded before it is sent, one per person per day. A failed send is retried on
  the next run; a second run on the same day sends only what is missing.
- **Test mode**: on until L&D switch it off. Every email goes to the test address, with the real recipient named in
  the subject, exactly as the old scripts do.
- **Resigned staff and people with no HOD** are never emailed. A department with no active HOD is listed in L&D's
  run summary.

## 5. Notifications inside LDMS

- A **bell** in the header with a count of unread, and a list: newest first, each line says what happened and opens
  the record. *Mark all as read*.
- A notification is written **when something happens to your record**: sent back, approved, evaluated and waiting
  for you, verified. It is written in the same step as the change, so it can't be missed or doubled.
- It does not replace *Waiting on you*. That shows what is waiting now; the bell shows what happened. A line is marked
  read when the record is opened.
- Notifications older than 90 days are removed by the daily job.
- **Browser push** (a pop-up when LDMS isn't open) is not in phase 4. It needs HTTPS on the live server and a
  permission on each device, and most shop-floor staff share a computer.

## 6. The dashboard

One screen, **Dashboard**, in the sidebar. A year picker; L&D also get a division and department picker.

**Training** (what the old dashboards showed, minus repeats of what Reports already has):

| Chart | Notes |
|---|---|
| Hours by month, Public / In-house, Departmental and OJT | Replaces *Public and OJT*. Stacked columns, with the old switch between total hours and average per person. |
| Hours by department | Replaces the nine division charts: one chart, the division chosen above. |
| Cost by month | Says how many trainings have no cost entered, so the gap is visible. |
| Most hours | The ten staff with the most hours, within what the viewer may see. L&D and HODs only. |

**Workflows** (new):

| Chart | Shows |
|---|---|
| PME | By department: waiting for the HOD, for the staff member, for L&D, and verified. Overdue ones counted separately. |
| Skill matrix | By department for the open quarter: not started, draft, waiting for the HOD, approved, against the number of staff who need one. |
| TNA | By department for the open year: not started, draft, with the HOD, approved. |
| TNI | Which departments have saved one for the open year. |

Each chart has a table behind it for screen readers and an Excel export of the same numbers. The existing overview
keeps its own cards; the L&D figures there link to this screen.

## 7. Build order

| Module | What it builds | You can check |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Groundwork** | The records for job runs, emails and notifications. The mail sender with test mode. `npm run job:daily`. A **Jobs and email** screen for L&D: each run with its counts, the test-mode switch, *Send a test email*, *Run now*. No reminders yet. | Send yourself a test email; see a run in the log. |
| **1. Notifications** | The bell and the list; a notification written by each PME, skill matrix and TNA step. | Send a TNA back as a HOD; see it in the staff member's bell. |
| **2. Reminders** | The twelve kinds, the combined email, how often, the switches, the *Chase from* date, the closing date for TNA and TNI. | In test mode, read the email each demo person would get and compare it with their *Waiting on you*. |
| **3. Dashboard: training** | The Dashboard screen and the four training charts, with the stacked chart piece. | Compare the totals with the Reports screens for the same year. |
| **4. Dashboard: workflows** | The four workflow charts and their exports. | Compare a department's counts with its PME, skill matrix and TNA lists. |
| **5. PDF reports** | The old PME report, training audit report and OJT audit report as PDFs, in the old layouts. Read the old pages first and confirm the layouts with L&D. | Put each beside the old system's PDF for the same training. |

### Module 0: Groundwork (built 8 Oct 2026, merged)

- **Jobs and email** (`/jobs`, Administration, L&D only: permission `jobs.manage`): how email is set up, test mode,
  the daily job's runs and the latest 50 emails with who each was meant for and where it went.
- **Email** (`src/server/mailer.ts`, `services/mail.ts`, `rules/mail.ts`): `queueEmail` writes the email down under a
  unique key, `sendEmail` sends it and records the result. A failed one is tried again by the next runs, three times
  in all. **Send a test email** goes to the signed-in person, or to the test address in Test; in Off it is only recorded.
- **Safe when unreadable**: a sending setting that can't be read counts as off, and a test-mode setting that can't
  be read counts as on with no address, so nothing reaches staff by accident.
- **The daily job** (`npm run job:daily`, `scripts/daily-job.ts`, `services/job.ts`): sends what is waiting, then
  removes emails, notifications and runs older than 90 days. One run at a time; a run that died is closed as
  failed after 30 minutes. **Run now** does the same from the screen.
- **Decided while building**
  - **One email mode on the screen: Off, Test or Live** (asked for 8 Oct 2026, instead of a line in `.env` and
    in place of separate sending and test-mode switches). Off: emails are only recorded, shown as *Recorded
    only*, and never sent later. Test: really sent, all to the test address typed in with it. Live: really sent to
    staff, behind a warning and a *Go live* button. It starts Off; Test and Live can't be chosen until the mail
    server is set up in `.env`; each change is in the audit log. The end-to-end tests put it to Off while they
    run. The mailbox address and password stay in `.env`: a password typed into a screen would sit in the
    database and its backups.
  - The `Notification` table is created now and first used in module 1.
  - Email bodies are kept (for retries) but never shown on the screen.

### Module 1: Notifications (built 8 Oct 2026, in review)

- **Notifications** (`/notifications`, everyone, under My work): the person's own list, newest first, 50 a page,
  unread ones in bold with a dot (amber when it asks them to do something). **Mark all as read**. The sidebar entry
  shows the unread count; on a phone or tablet a **bell** with the count sits in the top bar.
- **When one is written** (`rules/notification.ts`, `services/notification.ts`), always in the same transaction as
  the change, and never to the person who made it:

  | What happened | Who is told | Opens |
  |---|---|---|
  | The HOD evaluated a PME | The staff member | Their training's page, to acknowledge |
  | L&D verified a PME | The staff member | Their training's page |
  | L&D sent a PME back | The HOD who evaluates | The PME |
  | The HOD sent a skill matrix back, or approved it | Whoever filled it in | The matrix |
  | A TNA was sent back, approved, or reopened by L&D | The person it is about; for a job grade's, whoever submitted it | My TNA, or the job grade's TNA |

- **Opening one** goes through `/notifications/[id]/open`, which marks it read and goes to the record. Only the
  person it was written for can; anyone else gets 404.
- **Decided while building**
  - **A screen and a sidebar entry, not a pop-up list.** The desktop has no top bar to hang a bell on, and the
    sidebar already carries counts. The phone's top bar gets the bell.
  - **Read when opened from the list**, not whenever the record is opened some other way. Marking it from the
    record's own page would also mark it when the browser pre-loads a link.
  - **No notification for things already under Waiting on you**: a TNA or skill matrix submitted for approval, or
    a PME acknowledged and waiting for L&D. Those are counted in the sidebar and chased by the reminders of
    module 2; a notification each would double them.
  - Approving 40 skill matrices at once writes 40 notifications to their evaluators. If that proves noisy, it can
    become one line per approval.

## 8. Data model

```prisma
enum JobStatus { RUNNING  OK  FAILED }

model JobRun {              // one row per run of the daily job
  id            Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  job           String    @db.VarChar(40)   // "daily"
  startedAt     DateTime  @default(now())
  finishedAt    DateTime?
  status        JobStatus @default(RUNNING)
  summary       Json?                       // counts: due, sent, failed, skipped (no email), by kind
  error         String?   @db.Text
  startedById   Int?                        // null when the scheduler started it
}

enum EmailStatus { QUEUED  SENT  FAILED }

model EmailMessage {        // one row per email: what was meant for whom, and what happened
  id         Int         @id @default(autoincrement())
  staffId    Int?                            // who it is for
  intendedTo String      @db.VarChar(160)    // their address
  sentTo     String      @db.VarChar(160)    // the test address in test mode
  subject    String      @db.VarChar(200)
  body       String      @db.MediumText
  dedupeKey  String      @unique @db.VarChar(80)   // "digest:<staffId>:<YYYY-MM-DD>"
  status     EmailStatus @default(QUEUED)
  attempts   Int         @default(0)
  error      String?     @db.VarChar(500)
  jobRunId   Int?
  createdAt  DateTime    @default(now())
  sentAt     DateTime?
}

model Notification {        // the bell
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  staffId   Int
  kind      String    @db.VarChar(40)       // "tna.returned", "pme.evaluated", ...
  title     String    @db.VarChar(200)
  href      String    @db.VarChar(200)
  entity    String    @db.VarChar(40)
  entityId  Int
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  readAt    DateTime?
  @@index([staffId, readAt, createdAt])
}
```

Settings (the existing `Setting` table): `mail.testMode` (exists),
`reminders.kinds` (which are on), `reminders.chaseFrom` (a date), `tna.closingDate`. In `.env`: `SMTP_HOST`,
`SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_FROM`, and `APP_URL` for the links in emails.

One new package: `nodemailer`.

- **Rules** (`src/server/rules/reminder.ts`, pure and unit-tested): what goes into a person's list; the *Chase from* cut-off; the last month of a quarter; the closing-date window.
- **Services**: `reminder.ts` (who is waiting on what, for everyone at once), `mail.ts` (queue, send, retry, test
  mode), `job.ts` (start, finish, never two runs at once), `notification.ts`, and `dashboard.ts` extended.
- **Permission**: `jobs.manage` for L&D admins. Changes to switches and test mode go in the audit log.
- Email bodies hold staff names, so `EmailMessage` rows are removed after 90 days, with the notifications.

## 9. Security notes

- **The old mailbox password is in the old system's source code**, in five files, and that code is in a git
  repository. Whoever can read the code can send email as that mailbox. It should be changed whatever happens with
  v2, and v2 will use the new one from `.env`, never from code.
- The old reminder scripts can be started from a web address with a token that is also in the code. v2's job has no
  web address.
- The old log file names staff and their email addresses and sits under the web folder unless the server is set up
  otherwise. v2 keeps the record in the database, shown only to L&D.
- Emails contain names and training titles and nothing else: no marks, no ratings, no reasons for sending back.

## 10. Not in phase 4

- Browser push notifications (§5).
- Telling a division head when a HOD hasn't acted after some days. The dashboard shows it; an email about a
  colleague's lateness is a decision for L&D and management, not a default.
- Importing old records: phase 5.

## 11. Tests to add

- **Rules**: each of the twelve kinds in and out of its
  window; test mode's address and subject; one email per person per day.
- **A consistency test**: for each demo person, the reminder list equals what `*Waiting` returns for them.
- **End to end**: L&D run the job in test mode and see the run and its emails; a second run the same day sends
  nothing; a HOD sends a TNA back and the staff member's bell shows it; the Dashboard's totals match Reports; a
  staff member and a clerk are refused the Dashboard and the Jobs screen.
- No test ever sends a real email: the mail sender is swapped for one that only records.

## 12. Phase 4 is done when

- Everything in §7 works and is covered by the tests in §11.
- L&D have read a week of test-mode emails and agreed the wording.
- All checks pass: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run build`.
